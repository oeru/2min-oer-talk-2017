I'm Dave Lane from the Open Education Resource Foundation based in Dunedin, New Zealand.

Like Email, Equality is just quality updated for the digital era. Equity is like Equality, but with a stake, with a sense of ownership. Education is what ductile minds are naturally inclined to do, to explore themselves given the opportunity. In the Nature vs. Nurture debate, the most obvious external is opportunity - that part is not innate. That's where the OERFoundation comes it.

In the context of education, equality is simply "sameness". A dull instrument. Equity is one step removed, embracing a richer reality, accepting that each mind moves in its own direction, the direction in which it's inclined. Not on the same inclination. Equity is equality of opportunity. Enabling minds to evolve and expand into their attiude, guided by aptitude until they metamorph. Because metamorphosis is akin to magic we cannot understand it but we recognise it when we see it. At best, we can only hope create the conditions in which it seems to happen.

Learning requires sharing, giving, and enquiring. Nature gives us the foundations of attitude and aptitude. Open removes barriers, glass ceilings, steel floors. With open we follow our curiosity, explore. Closed is a tease - lures us in with promises of "easy" then it holds out its hand, rubs its fingers expectantly... or it shuts the door.

We cannot affect that which is within learners, but we can affect that which they are without. The Internet, the global copying machine, stymied at every turn by existing fortunes, by old, closed thinking. Nonetheless, the Internet succeeds in offering something completely new: the ability for a few dedicated people to reach a global audience, and provide for them the tools with which to create a global, cross-cultural community based on a common goal - the ability to scale and realistically offer equity in educational opportunity.

Our kindred spirits from all over the world work away for all to see, working out in the open collaboratively, assembling the structure of a moden open higher education. They, and the institutions they represent, are testing new open ideas and new open tools which have never been marketed to them by corporations. Nonetheless, they are excited and inspired - who would have thought we would create a rich, open educational edifice in a wiki for all to discover and explore.

With our partners, we're pioneering a new model - education freely available to all. Only assessment - for real credentials - comes at a cost - a modest cost. But our model removes the tyranny of georgraphy. No matter who your are or where you are, the OERu is your opportunity, and for many it might be the only difference between fulfillment and wondering what might have been. No longer need potential lie dormant, ambitions be fustrated, genius fizzle unexpressed. Our collective goal is to remedy inequity of higher educational opportunity, not with a pale imitation, but with something new. Rather than nuggets, fries, and a coke, we are creating the higher learning equivalent of a home cooked meal, made from locally sourced ingedients, carrying the love of a community.

Talk about sharing requiring open, closed is anathema.

Minds resonate at different frequency, as it has to be, if we want a rich diverse society. Straight equality is a simplistic measure, we're working for nothing less than global equity of opportunity.


You can't learn without interest, or teach without sharing.
Nature vs. nurture, it takes both.


Nurture gives us context, confidence, and, if we're lucky, opportunity. Let us engineer that luck. Our community has power


A friend recently said: "Which in turn ties into that prosperity doctrine bullshit where everyone who _doesn't_ succeed mustn't have tried. Their idea of meritocracy suffers a lot from survivorship bias.

Privilege in the American context seems to be about need to recognise that while they may be running in the same race, not everyone starts at the same point. Not everyone has the same number of hurdles to clear, nor are those hurdles at the same height. So the focus there is on knocking down the bigger hurdles because they infringe on freedom of opportunity, with equality of outcome as a secondary thought."

"One of the big problems with most any "true equality" is that such a truth is objectively very hard to measure - and the subjective truths vary wildly and can often be in conflict.

Models that treat people as the same when they aren't have the same potential to cause injustice as models that treat people as different where they aren't. Discussions on the "truths" of equitability, justice and fairness have been ongoing and evolving about as long as we've had societies."

A couple years ago I was having a Twitter exchange with some people talking about quirky collective nouns for things, like a "murder" of crows, a rabble of butterflies, a mischief of mice, a pounce of cats, a flange of baboons, a parliament of owls, a bloat of hippopotamuses, a goring of butchers, a superfluity of nuns... and I asked "Is there a collective noun for hipsters?" The usual decidedly non-hipster suspects replied with obivous and clearly wrong suggestions like "an emo of hipsters"...

A few hours later, I got an unexpected reply from someone whose Twitter handle I didn't recognise. This person said "Yes, there's a term for it, but it's pretty obscure, you probably haven't heard it". It was subtle, it was evasive, and vaguely elitist. In short, it was perfect. Before the hour was up, someone else I'd never heard of replied to us both with a picture of the t-shirt design she'd put together showing speech bubbles of our exchange and a link to buy it from her online t-shirt store. Yes, when you use services like Twitter for free, *you* are the product.

How many of you in the room would classify yourselves as hipsters? The idea of accepting and promoting that label is inherently anti-hipster. It's something usually only conferred on you by others, sort of like "she's humble" or "he's quite a good leader", or "they're a great teacher".

We ourselves decide if we want to learn. No one else can decide it for us. That personal motivation is one of the three characteristics I think are key to learning. The other two are aptitude - the cognitive ability to learn - and opportunity. Motivation and aptitude are innate - we either have them or we don't - but the last, opportunity, is at least partly external. Yes, an individual can seek out opportunity, but due to circumstance and privilege some need seek far less arduously than others.

We know that the only real solution to many of the world's existential ills - disease, overpopulation, religion, exploitation, ecological destruction - is education. In many parts of the world, often including our very own neighbourhoods, there is a great inequity of opportunity for learners. Regardless of their aptitude and motivation, the circumstances of some effectively block access to higher education. We will never be able to build traditional higher education institutions at the rate needed to meet the burgeoning demand. Even if we could meet that demand, there would still be many who due to geographic, employment, or familial circumstances could never take up that opportunity. We need to complement traditional higher education with a different approach.

One of the most miraculous and fundamental transitions in human history is the recent spread of pervasive digital communications across the globe. The Internet has created a nervous system for our planet, creating unprecedented economies of scale, and overcoming the tyranny of concentrated capital, and even the fundamental economics of scarity under which we have lived since the dawn of civilisation. The new era of Digital Abundance has allowed clever people create new communication models that visionary educators have employed to address inequity of opportunity for learners. And they can do this in "Internet time" - months, not the decades typical of "academy" - with small teams, and on a shoestring budget.

I consider myself very fortunate to have found a role with the Open Education Resource Foundation - a lean, forward looking, open institution which affords me the most rewarding and ethically pure livelihood I could imagine: creating educational opportunity for learners in a way that adapts to a rapidly changing educational expectations, and can handle exponential growth - that can achieve global "Internet scale" because that is what we need.

So I'm contradicting my earlier statement: if you use a free internet service, you are not always the product being sold. Sometimes, you're just gaining the ability to participate in an expanding ever richer global digital commons. My colleagues in the OERu and I are working to ensure that, in some rare and generally obscure and underadvertised places, those with sufficient motivation and aptitude to learn just might experience equity of opportunity.
