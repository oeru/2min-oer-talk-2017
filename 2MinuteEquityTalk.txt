Like email, equality is just quality updated for the digital era. Equity is like equality, but with a stake, with a sense of ownership. Education is what ductile minds are naturally inclined to do, to explore themselves given the opportunity. In the Nature vs. Nurture debate, the main external is opportunity - that part is not innate. That's where the OERFoundation comes it.

In the context of eductation, equality is simply the same. A dull instrument. Equity is one step removed, embracing a richer reality, accepting that each mind moves in its own direction, the direction it's inclined. Not on the same inclination. Equity is equality of opportunity. Enabling minds to evolve and expand into their attiude, guided by aptitude until they metamorph. Because metamorphosis is magic, beyond our ken. We can only hope create the conditions to enable it.

Learning requires sharing, giving and enquiring. Nature gives us the foundations of attitude and aptitude. Open removes barriers, glass ceilings, steel floors. With open we follow our curiosity, explore. Closed is a tease - lures us in with promises of "easy" then it holds out its hand, rubs its fingers or it shuts the door.

Nurture gives us context, confidence, and, if we're lucky, opportunity. Let us engineer that luck. Our community has power

Talk about sharing requiring open, closed is anathema.

Minds resonate at different frequency, as it has to be, if we want a rich diverse society. Straight equality is a simplistic measure, we need equality of opportunity.


You can't learn without interest, or teach without sharing.
Nature vs. nurture, it takes both.

A couple years ago I was having a Twitter exchange with some people talking about quirky collective nouns for things, like a "murder" of crows, a rabble of butterflies, a mischief of mice, a pounce of cats, a flange of baboons, a parliament of owls, a bloat of hippopotamuses, a goring of butchers, a superfluity of nuns... and I asked "Is there a collective noun for hipsters?" The usual decidedly non-hipster suspects replied with obivous and clearly wrong suggestions like "an emo of hipsters"...

A few hours later, I got an unexpected reply from someone whose Twitter handle I didn't recognise. This person said "Yes, there's a term for it, but it's pretty obscure, you probably haven't heard it". It was subtle, it was evasive, and vaguely elitist. In short, it was perfect. Before the hour was up, someone else I'd never heard of replied to us both with a picture of the t-shirt design she'd put together showing speech bubbles of our exchange and a link to buy it from her online t-shirt store. Yes, when you use services like Twitter for free, *you* are the product.

How many of you in the room would classify yourselves as hipsters? The idea of accepting and promoting that label is inherently anti-hipster. It's something usually only conferred on you by others, sort of like "she's humble" or "he's quite a good leader", or "they're a great teacher".

We ourselves decide if we want to learn. No one else can decide it for us. That personal motivation is one of the three characteristics I think are key to learning. The other two are aptitude - the cognitive ability to learn - and opportunity. Motivation and aptitude are innate - we either have them or we don't - but the last, opportunity, is at least partly external. Yes, an individual can seek out opportunity, but due to circumstance and privilege some need seek far less arduously than others.

We know that the only real solution to many of the world's existential ills - disease, overpopulation, religion, exploitation, ecological destruction - is education. In many parts of the world, often including our very own neighbourhoods, there is a great inequity of opportunity for learners. Regardless of their aptitude and motivation, the circumstances of some effectively block access to higher education. We will never be able to build traditional higher education institutions at the rate needed to meet the burgeoning demand. Even if we could meet that demand, there would still be many who due to geographic, employment, or familial circumstances could never take up that opportunity. We need to complement traditional higher education with a different approach.

One of the most miraculous and fundamental transitions in human history is the recent spread of pervasive digital communications across the globe. The Internet has created a nervous system for our planet, creating unprecedented economies of scale, and overcoming the tyranny of concentrated capital, and even the fundamental economics of scarity under which we have lived since the dawn of civilisation. The new era of Digital Abundance has allowed clever people create new communication models that visionary educators have employed to address inequity of opportunity for learners. And they can do this in "Internet time" - months, not the decades typical of "academy" - with small teams, and on a shoestring budget.

I consider myself very fortunate to have found a role with the Open Education Resource Foundation - a lean, forward looking, open institution which affords me the most rewarding and ethically pure livelihood I could imagine: creating educational opportunity for learners in a way that adapts to a rapidly changing educational expectations, and can handle exponential growth - that can achieve global "Internet scale" because that is what we need.

So I'm contradicting my earlier statement: if you use a free internet service, you are not always the product being sold. Sometimes, you're just gaining the ability to participate in an expanding ever richer global digital commons. My colleagues in the OERu and I are working to ensure that, in some rare and generally obscure and underadvertised places, those with sufficient motivation and aptitude to learn just might experience equity of opportunity.
