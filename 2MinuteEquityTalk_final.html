<h1>Hewlett Annual OER Meeting 2017</h1>

<p>I'm Dave Lane from the OER Foundation.</p>

<p>William Gibson <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Gibson">famously said</a> "the future is already here - it's just not very evenly distributed." It turns out that the same can be said about opportunities for higher education. The OER Foundation is working to address both of these distribution problems.</p>

<p>The Internet is a global copying machine. Access to it is rippling across the planet with breathtaking speed, sometimes even preceding things like running water, rule of law, and educational institutions. It's disruption is profound and threatens existing fortunes and old, closed thinking. The dinosaurs - kings of the bygone era - are fighting its emergence tooth and nail, influencing legislation to protect their historical advantage and creating artificial scarcity using government granted monopolies like patents and copyright.</p>

<p>Some of us see an opportunity to adapt instead. The Internet offers us something completely new: suddenly small distributed but dedicated groups can use free and open tools to engage with a global audience even with humble resources.</p>

<p>Open-minded kindred spirits from all over the world are working collaboratively, in the open, assembling a higher education curriculum. They employ ideas and tools which have never been marketed to them by corporations. They wield them with excitment, inspiration, and great effect.</p>

<p>Who would have thought we would create a vibrant, openly accessible education ecosystem in a <a href="http://wikieducator.org">humble wiki</a>, without anyone being unjustly separated from their autonomy, their money, or their dignity.</p>

<p>With our partners, we are pioneering "freely available, permissionless, education for all" with our <a href="https://oeru.org">OERu</a> <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OERu/OERu_16.10_Meeting/Report#Day_2:Implementing_the_OERu_1st_year_of_study_and_beyond">1st year of study</a>. The only cost is if you want to be assessed for a real qualification. Our model removes the tyranny of geography and personal circumstance.</p>

<p>No longer does potential need to lie unrealised, ambitions be frustrated, or genius fizzle unexpressed. Our collective goal is to remedy inequity of opportunity, not with a pale copy of what exists, but with something new. By combining the Internet, OERs, and a deep commitment to the principles of open, the OERu will deliver nothing less than global, individualised equity-in-education.</p>
