<p>I'm Dave Lane from the OER Foundation based in Dunedin, New Zealand.</p>

<p>William Gibson <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Gibson">famously said</a> "the future is already here - it's just not very evenly distributed." It turns out that the same can be said about opportunities for higher education. The OER Foundation is working to address both of these distribution problems.</p>

<p>The Internet is a global copying machine. Access to it is rippling across the planet with breathtaking speed, sometimes even preceding things like running water, rule of law, educational institutions, and reality TV. It's disruption is profound and threatens existing fortunes and old, closed thinking. The dinosaurs - kings of the bygone era - are fighting its emergence tooth and nail, influencing legislation to protect their historical advantage and creating artificial scarcity using government granted monopolies like patents and copyright.</p>

<p>Some of us see an opportunity to adapt instead. The Internet offers us something completely new: suddenly small distributed but dedicated groups, despite being of humble means, can use free and open tools to engage with a global audience.</p>

<p>Open-minded kindred spirits from all over the world are working collaboratively, in the open, assembling an open higher education curriculum. They employ ideas and tools which have never been marketed to them by corporations. They are excited, inspired, and effective. Who would have thought we would create a vibrant, openly accessible education ecosystem in a <a href="http://wikieducator.org">humble wiki</a>, without anyone being separated from their autonomy, their dignity, or their life's savings.</p>

<p>With our partners, we are pioneering freely available education for all with our <a href="https://oeru.org">OERu</a> 1st year of study. Only assessment for real qualifications comes at a fair and reasonable cost. Our model removes the tyranny of geography and personal circumstance.</p>

<p>No longer does potential need to lie unrealised, ambitions be frustrated, or genius fizzle unexpressed. Our collective goal is to remedy inequity of opportunity, not with a pale copy of what exists, but with something new. By combining the Internet, OERs, and a deep commitment to the principles of open, the OERu will deliver nothing less than global, individualised, self-service equity-in-education.</p>
